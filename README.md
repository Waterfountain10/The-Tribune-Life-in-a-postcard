# Sheridan Curteanu Photography Website

## Overview
This website was created for photographer Sheridan Curteanu. As the web developer for The Tribune, I collaborated with Sheridan to showcase her artwork in a personalized website.

The site highlights Sheridan's photography and provides an engaging platform for visitors to explore her art. The website was designed using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and some JavaScript.
