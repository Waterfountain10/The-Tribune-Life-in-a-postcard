        <h2>Life in a Postcard</h2>
        <p><strong>Sheridan Curteanu</strong><br>
        March 12th, 2024</p>
        
        <p>I call this series <em>Life in a Postcard</em> a visual love letter to my hometown. Growing up, I failed to take the time to explore the possibilities within my small rural town. My parents were never big outdoor people, and since I was little, nothing seemed to matter except school and sports. After suffering a sports injury that ultimately ended my time with that sport, I began to look for meaning in other things. I found myself leaning on art, music, and the outdoors during this time. What seemed in the moment an incredible loss ended up introducing me to something even more inspiring and significant to my life today.</p>
        
        <p>Combining my love for photography and the outdoors has been such a gift. While I could never convey the entire experience of being within the mountains, photography has allowed me to express my love for the outdoors and has offered me an opportunity to attempt to the best of my abilities to share its beauty.</p>
        
        <p>Along with my love for the outdoors is my love for my friend; who was key in introducing me to it. Portrayed in a couple of photos within this series, it cannot be over-emphasized her contributions to these experiences.</p>
        
        <p>Behind every one of these photos is a mind, body, and soul experience. If I had one wish, it would be to give the world these moments.</p>
